Meeting Details: 
• This meeting primarily focused on reviewing the nearly completed SRS and planning for its completion by Monday February 15.
• Document formatting was discussed. Garamond with slightly larger fonts for titles and bolded section numbers was selected.
• Section 2 will be revised to contain a better overview of the requirements with fewer details on the implementation
• Section 3.5 will be updated to contain better fault toleration information. Hospitals do not have off hours so the primary focus will be on quick (possibly live) updates and a robust system that can remain online for many consecutive hours.
• The user interfaces outlined in section 3.2 will be expanded to include further details about how different types of users will interact with the system.
• Yixun is selected as project leader for deliverable 2.
• Tyler is selected as recorder for deliverable 2.
Action Items:
• Edit sections 2 and 3.5 based on today’s discussion - Tyler
• Add user functions and additional user interface descriptions to the SRS - Yixun
• Update definitions and references to reflect content in sections completed by Tyler and Yixun, format SRS - Jakob
• Format minutes and post to github - Jakob
End of Meeting: 12:32 pm
